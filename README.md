# NumpadKeyboard

To use, download the ZIP of this repository. The file will be called numpadkeyboard-master.

Unzip the file and open up "numpadkeyboard-master/calc_pad/CalculatorKeyboard-master/CalculatorKeyboard.xcworkspace". 

When it is open, click on the project navigator (top left folder icon). Expand "CalculatorKeyboard", then "Calculator", then "t9". Right click the "t9" folder and click "Add Files to CalculatorKeyboard...". It should present you with the directory of the project, click "StreamReader.swift" and press "Add". Now build it and it will run the simulator. 

The app will show instructions on how to set up the keyboard. 

Once you set up the keyboard, go to any app that constructs text and choose the Numpad option for your keyboard using the global keyboard switch.

Then, use the keyboard as desired.
