# NumpadKeyboard

## Set Up
To use, download the ZIP of this repository. The file will be called numpadkeyboard-master.

Unzip the file and open up "numpadkeyboard-master/calc_pad/CalculatorKeyboard-master/CalculatorKeyboard.xcworkspace". 

Build the project and it will run the simulator. 

The app will show instructions on how to set up the keyboard. 

Once you set up the keyboard, go to any app that constructs text and choose the Numpad option for your keyboard using the global keyboard switch.

Then, use the keyboard as desired.
